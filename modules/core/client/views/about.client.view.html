    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am Kelsey Brisson, and I am a web developer. I have spent the past two years working as a C# .NET developer for a high profile client. During this time I had the opportunity to architect an equity screener and was also able to expand my knowledge about D3js by building an interactive mapping library. Now, my experience working on a large site with custom CDNs has inspired me to start creating responsive stand-alone JavaScript plugins while minimizing file size. I have also been working on learning AngularJS and how to build sites with MEAN.JS.
